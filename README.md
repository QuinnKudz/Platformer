# Platformer
Android platformer game made within Android studio 
Made as part of teh course "Game Development for Android" at Uppsala University in Spring of 2018. This project serves as a basic
platformer, which utalizes a levelManager that takes a matrix filled with values tied to rescources and generates the playing
field. It also features support for 3 types of controls at once, with another method possible with small alteration. 
The 3 controls implemented currently are the virtual joystick, accelerometer and physical controller. A game pad is useable if mainactivity.xml is altered by uncommenting the one line that is a comment and then commenting out the line below it. 
You will also need to uncomment the line in the MainActivity class.
